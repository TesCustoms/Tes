python-OBD
==========

A python module for handling realtime sensor data from OBD-II vehicle
ports. Works with ELM327 OBD-II adapters, and is fit for the Raspberry
Pi.

Installation
------------

```Shell
$ pip install obd
```

Basic Usage
-----------

```Python
import obd

connection = obd.OBD() # auto-connects to USB or RF port

cmd = obd.commands.SPEED # select an OBD command (sensor)

response = connection.query(cmd) # send the command, and parse the response

print(response.value) # returns unit-bearing values thanks to Pint
print(response.value.to("mph")) # user-friendly unit conversions
```
