Controller Area Network (CAN) is main bus - ISO11898
> Twisted Pair at upto 1 Mbps
> Dominant "0" less then 0.5 V Recessive "1" greater then 0.9V
Local Interconnect Newtork (LIN) extends CAN down into sub system off main loop
> Single ended one wire at upto 20 kbps - Single master wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiith upto 16 slaves 
> V_BAT level signal with wave shaping 
> Dominant "0" less then 0.4 V Recessive "1" greater then 0.6V

TX + RX = TRX (Transceiver)
120 Ohmn termanators on both ends with spilt configuration being better for signal intergery 
60 / 60 spilt with 10 nF capaticator for spilt configuration

Most CAN Transceivers are 8 pin IC's but 14 pin IC's add low power mode, fault detection

Loop Time in CAN depends on:
1) CAN Controller IO (TXD/RXD) - VERY SMALL
2) CAN Transceiver Driver and REceiver Delay (Loop Delay or T_Loop)
3) Cable lnegth (5 ns/m and max of 40 m at 1 Mbps)
4) Series components like isolators

Round Trip Delay = 2 x (Cable Length Delay + Isolator Delay + Transceiver Delay + Controler IO Delay)

6 bits of the same type 111_111 or 000_000 are considered an error on a CAN Bus

TXD is data from microcontroller  you want sent to CAN Bus in serial format with is converted to CANH and CANL signals through an op amp

RXD is data coming from CAN bus that has been converted in serial format for microcontroller to parse and make decisions on
> RXD need pull up resistor for high data rates


Can Flexible Data (FD) Rate is faster upto 2+ Mbps
Arbitration occurs at normal CAN data rate but Data Field Length can be upto 64 bytes (8x larger) and faster!!
